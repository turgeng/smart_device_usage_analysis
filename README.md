## Analysis Overview

The analysis focuses on:

- **Activity behavior**: Steps, calories burned, active minutes
- **Sleep behavior**: Duration, consistency, efficiency
- **Consistency patterns**: Regularity of usage
- **Cross-analysis**: Do active users sleep better?

Key techniques: data cleaning, aggregation, joining datasets, trend exploration, and correlation analysis.

---

## Key Insights

- Consistency in tracking correlates with higher activity and better sleep efficiency.
- Sedentary users and low consistency users can be targeted for re-engagement.
- The Leaf product can be marketed toward users valuing regular wellness tracking.

---

## Limitations

- Small sample (30 users), from 2016
- No demographic info (e.g., gender, age)
- Assumes Fitbit behavior is generalizable

---

## Future Directions

- Use larger and current datasets
- Incorporate user segments (e.g., by age/gender if available)
- Combine with Bellabeat’s proprietary data
